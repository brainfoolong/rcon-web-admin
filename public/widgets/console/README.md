# Console widget

Read and control the command line rcon console of your server. You will have access to all rcon commands and you are able to execute all commands. This is the most powerful thing you can do with RCON, but it also requires some knowledge about the commands.

# Features
* Live server log
* Persistant, downloadable server log files
* Execute rcon commands
* See all available commands

# Limits
Each logfile can not be bigger than 1MB. We automatically roll the logfiles and a maximum number of 10 logfiles will be kept. So, each server can only store 10MB of server log files with this widget.
